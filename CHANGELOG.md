# Changelog

All notable changes to the KiCAD MCP Server project are documented here.

## [2.2.1-alpha] - 2026-02-28

### New MCP Tools

- `edit_schematic_component` – Update properties of a placed symbol in-place (footprint,
  value, reference rename). More efficient than delete + re-add: preserves position and UUID.

### Bug Fixes

- `add_schematic_component`: `footprint` parameter was accepted but silently ignored – the
  value was never passed through to `DynamicSymbolLoader.add_component()` /
  `create_component_instance()`. All newly placed symbols always had an empty Footprint
  field. Fix: added `footprint: str = ""` to both functions and threaded it through every
  call site including the TypeScript tool schema.

- `delete_schematic_component`: only deleted the first matching instance when duplicate
  references existed (e.g. after an aborted add attempt). Root cause: loop used `break`
  after the first match. Fix: collect all matching blocks first, then delete them all back-
  to-front (to preserve line indices). Response now includes `deleted_count`.

- `templates/*.kicad_sch`, `project.py`, `schematic.py`: Update KiCAD schematic format
  version from `20230121` (KiCAD 7) to `20250114` (KiCAD 9). The MCP server targets
  KiCAD 9 exclusively (`pcbnew.pyd` compiled for KiCAD 9.0, Python 3.11.5) – generating
  files in an outdated format caused a spurious "This file was created with an older
  KiCAD version" warning on every newly created schematic.

- `template_with_symbols_expanded.kicad_sch`: Remove 13 corrupt `_TEMPLATE_*` placed-symbol
  blocks with `(lib_id -100)` – an integer caused by old sexpdata serializer (same bug
  PR #40 fixed for the add path). KiCAD crashed with a null-pointer when selecting these
  symbols. They appeared as grey `_TEMPLATE_R?`, `_TEMPLATE_U_REG?` etc. labels far
  outside the sheet boundary (~5000mm off-sheet).

  **Discovered via:** live testing on a real JLCPCB/KiCAD 9 project.
  **Affected users:** schematics created from this template before this fix contain the
  same corrupt blocks – remove all `(symbol (lib_id -100) ...)` blocks whose Reference
  starts with `_TEMPLATE_`.

## [2.2.0-alpha] - 2026-02-27

### New MCP Tools (TypeScript layer – previously Python-only)

**Routing tools:**
- `delete_trace` - Delete traces by UUID, position or net name
- `query_traces` - Query/filter traces on the board
- `get_nets_list` - List all nets with net code and class
- `modify_trace` - Modify trace width or layer
- `create_netclass` - Create or update a net class
- `route_differential_pair` - Route a differential pair between two points
- `refill_zones` - Refill all copper zones ⚠️ SWIG segfault risk, prefer IPC/UI

**Component tools:**
- `get_component_pads` - Get all pad data for a component
- `get_component_list` - List all components on the board
- `get_pad_position` - Get absolute position of a specific pad
- `place_component_array` - Place components in a grid array
- `align_components` - Align components along an axis
- `duplicate_component` - Duplicate a component with offset

### Bug Fixes

- `routing.py`: Fix SwigPyObject UUID comparison (`str()` → `m_Uuid.AsString()`)
- `routing.py`: Fix SWIG iterator invalidation after `board.Remove()` by snapshotting `list(board.Tracks())`
- `routing.py`: Add `board.SetModified()` + `track = None` after `Remove()` to prevent dangling SWIG pointer crashes
- `routing.py`: Per-track `try/except` in `query_traces()` to skip invalid objects after bulk delete
- `routing.py`: Add missing return statement (mypy)
- `library.py`: Fix `search_footprints` parameter mapping (`search_term` → `pattern`)
- `library.py`: Fix field access (`fp.name` → `fp.full_name`)
- `library.py`: Accept both `pattern` and `search_term` parameter names
- `library.py`: Fix loop variable shadowing `Path` object (mypy)
- `design_rules.py`: Add type annotation for `violation_counts` (mypy)

### New MCP Tools (cont.)

**Datasheet tools:**
- `get_datasheet_url` - Return LCSC datasheet PDF URL and product page URL for a given
  LCSC number (e.g. `C179739` → `https://www.lcsc.com/datasheet/C179739.pdf`).
  No API key required – URL is constructed directly from the LCSC number.
- `enrich_datasheets` - Scan a `.kicad_sch` file and write LCSC datasheet URLs into
  every symbol that has an `LCSC` property but an empty `Datasheet` field. After
  enrichment the URL appears natively in KiCAD's symbol properties, footprint browser
  and any other tool that reads the standard KiCAD `Datasheet` field.
  Supports `dry_run=true` for preview without writing.
  Implementation: `python/commands/datasheet_manager.py` (text-based, no `skip` writes)

**Schematic tools:**
- `delete_schematic_component` - Remove a placed symbol from a `.kicad_sch` file by
  reference designator (e.g. `R1`, `U3`).

### Bug Fixes (cont.)

- `schematic.ts` / `kicad_interface.py`: Fix missing `delete_schematic_component` MCP tool.

  **Root cause (two separate issues):**
  1. No MCP tool named `delete_schematic_component` existed. Claude had no way to call
     it, so any "delete schematic component" request fell through to the PCB-only
     `delete_component` tool, which searches `pcbnew.BOARD` and always returned
     "Component not found" for schematic symbols.
  2. `component_schematic.py::remove_component()` still used `skip` for writes.
     PR #40 rewrote `DynamicSymbolLoader` (add path) to avoid `skip`-induced schematic
     corruption, but `remove_component` (delete path) was not touched by that PR.

  **Fix:**
  - Added `delete_schematic_component` to the TypeScript tool layer (`schematic.ts`)
    with clear docstring distinguishing it from the PCB `delete_component`.
  - Implemented `_handle_delete_schematic_component` in `kicad_interface.py` using
    direct text manipulation (parenthesis-depth tracking, same approach as PR #40).
    Does not call `component_schematic.py::remove_component()` at all.
  - Error message explicitly guides the user when the wrong tool is used:
    *"note: this tool removes schematic symbols, use delete_component for PCB footprints"*

### Additional Bug Fixes

- `connection_schematic.py` / `kicad_interface.py`: Fix `generate_netlist` missing
  `schematic_path` parameter – without it `get_net_connections` always fell back to
  proximity matching which only returns one connection per component (first wire hit,
  then `break`). PinLocator was never invoked. Fix: added `schematic_path: Optional[Path]`
  to `generate_netlist` signature and threaded it through to `get_net_connections`,
  and updated `_handle_generate_netlist` in `kicad_interface.py` to pass `schematic_path`.
- `server.ts`: Fix KiCAD bundled Python (3.11.5) not being selected on Windows – the
  detection condition `process.env.PYTHONPATH?.includes("KiCad")` was fragile and failed
  in some environments, causing System Python 3.12 to be used instead. Since `pcbnew.pyd`
  is compiled for KiCAD's Python 3.11.5, this resulted in `No module named 'pcbnew'`.
  Fix: removed the condition, KiCAD bundled Python is now always preferred on Windows
  when it exists at `C:\Program Files\KiCad\9.0\bin\python.exe`.
  Also added `KICAD_PYTHON` to `claude_desktop_config.json` as explicit override.
- `pin_locator.py`: Fix `generate_netlist` timeout – `get_pin_location` and
  `get_all_symbol_pins` called `Schematic(schematic_path)` on every single pin lookup,
  causing O(nets × components × pins) schematic file loads (e.g. 400+ loads for a
  medium schematic). Fix: added `_schematic_cache` dict to `PinLocator.__init__`,
  schematic is now loaded once per path and reused.
