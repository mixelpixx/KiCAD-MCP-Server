{{differential_pairs}}

When routing differential pairs, follow these best practices:

1. Length Matching:
   - Keep both traces in each pair the same length
   - Maintain consistent spacing between the traces
   - Use serpentine routing (meanders) for length matching when necessary

2. Impedance Control:
   - Maintain consistent trace width and spacing to control impedance
   - Consider the layer stack-up and dielectric properties
   - Avoid changing layers if possible; when necessary, use symmetrical via pairs

3. Coupling and Crosstalk:
   - Keep differential pairs tightly coupled to each other
   - Maintain adequate spacing between different differential pairs
   - Route away from single-ended signals that could cause interference

4. Reference Planes:
   - Route over continuous reference planes
   - Avoid splits in reference planes under differential pairs
   - Consider the return path for the signals

5. Termination:
   - Plan for proper termination at the ends of the pairs
   - Consider the need for series or parallel termination resistors
   - Place termination components close to the endpoints
